**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

## Features

 * Handles most CSS 2.1 and a few CSS3 properties, including @import, @media &
   @page rules
 * Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
 * Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
   fopen-wrappers)
 * Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
   border models, individual cell styling
 * Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
 * No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
 * Inline PHP support
 * Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)
 
## Requirements

 * PHP version 7.1 or higher
 * DOM extension
 * MBString extension
 * php-font-lib
 * php-svg-lib
 
Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies 
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

 * OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance
 * GD (for image processing)
 * IMagick or GMagick extension: improves image processing performance

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu
Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.
